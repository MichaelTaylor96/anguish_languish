#Anguish Languish Translator

The Anguish Languish is exactly like the English Language, except the words are exchanged for words that sound similar, but are entirely different. For example, the English phrase "on the edge of a large, dark forest" becomes "honor itch offer lodge, dock florist" when translated into Anguish. Notice that the English and Anguish phrases do not have the same number of words: All that matters is that the phonix of the Anguish sentence sound as close to the original as possible. I took the task of creating an algorithm to translate English to Anguish, by translating English into phonemes and then ranking possible alternate solutions, even considering stress. It works sufficiently, but is still not as good as solutions that a human might come up with.
